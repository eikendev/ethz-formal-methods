## About

This repository contains proofs for different security properties of the OTR and PAKE security protocols.
It was created as a project in the lecture "Formal Methods for Information Security" at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/).

[Robertas](https://github.com/RequestForCoffee) and me wrote the proofs in pair programming sessions over [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Conveniently, this enabled us to share the web server of the [Tamarin prover](https://tamarin-prover.github.io/) without any more complex setup.
